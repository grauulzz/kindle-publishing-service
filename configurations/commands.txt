The purpose
of this ALB (Application Load Balancer) will be to provide a publicly accessible URL which
we can send HTTP requests to, and to distribute network traffic across the two duplicate
Task instances we are going to set up for our project.

While one Task is busy, the ALB will
automatically direct incoming traffic to the second Task
